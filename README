a sketchboard for soccer game on which you can set positions and names of
players and do some chalk drawing.

you can share the positions and names you set by a link after you finish your
job.

there is a single global sketchboard, every move you do is saved on server
except chalk moves. 

TODO:
-----
[ ] should remember colors of players at latest order on resets.
[ ] should use scoped boards to share real time data between visitors.

KNOWN BUGS:
-----------
[ ] positioning of scretches on board is wrong for some versions of firefox and
opera (ex: opera 10.10 for mac, firefox 3.6.12 for mac)
